A vibe-coded, lightweight, single-file web application for creating and chatting with AI-powered characters. Built with vanilla JavaScript and Google's Gemini AI, this application runs entirely in the browser‚Äîno server required.

## Purpose
This repository is a demo and exploration of creating a custom AI character chatbot app. It‚Äôs not a template for mass adoption or open-source collaboration‚Äîjust a public display of what happens when you let vibes (and AI) guide your coding.

> **Not accepting contributions or issues.** If you vibe with it, fork away and make it your own!

## üö´ No Live Demo
This project does not provide a hosted live demo. Because it requires your own Google AI API key, and to protect user security and privacy, it is designed to run locally in your browser. Simply follow the steps below to get started on your own machine.
