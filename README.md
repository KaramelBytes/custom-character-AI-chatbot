A vibe-coded, lightweight, single-file web application for creating and chatting with AI-powered characters. Built with vanilla JavaScript and Google's Gemini AI, this application runs entirely in the browser with no server required.

## Purpose
This repository is a demo and exploration of creating a custom AI character chatbot app. It‚Äôs not a template for mass adoption or open-source collaboration‚Äîjust a public display of what happens when you let vibes (and AI) guide your coding.

> **Not accepting contributions or issues.** If you vibe with it, fork away and make it your own!
